It was introduced in 2020 as a replacement for the popular transformer model, BERT, in the Transformers library.\n\n**How does LangFuse work?**\n\nLangFuse consists of several components that work together to generate text. These components include:\n\n1. A transformer encoder: This component takes in a sequence of words and generates a sequence of vectors that represent the grammar and syntax of the input text.\n2. A model for generating new text: This component uses the outputs from the transformer encoder to generate new text that is similar in style and structure to the input text.\n3. A model for controlling the output: This component allows the user to specify specific parameters, such as the word order, sentence structure, and style of the output text.\n\n**Application in generative AI projects**\n\nLangFuse has been applied in a variety of generative AI projects, including:\n\n1. **Text-to-Text Transfer**: LangFuse has been used to generate text that is similar to a given text, while also incorporating specific features or styles.\n2. **Language Modeling**: LangFuse[engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

The earliest recorded evidence of kite-like flying devices dates back to the 3rd millennium BC in ancient China, where they were used for military reconnaissance and as a form of entertainment.\n\nIn ancient China, kites were typically made from bamboo or silk, with materials such as ribbons, strings, and wooden or plastic frames. The silk kites were particularly popular, and their designs became more complex and detailed over time.\n\n**The History of Kites in the Western World**\n\nKites arrived in the Western world in the 13th century, specifically in the Middle East and North Africa, where they were known as \"kites\" and \"torse\" (also spelled \"torse\"). The first recorded mention of kite flying in Europe was in 1271 in Venice, Italy, where it was used for scientific purposes.\n\nIn the 14th century, kites began to appear in England, particularly in the city of London.

I'll simulate a Python function that returns the song \"Thriller\" by Michael Jackson and a full volume.\n\nHere is the function:\n\n```\n{\"name\": \"play_song\", \"parameters\":{\"query\": \"Thriller by Michael Jackson\", \"shuffle\": false}}, \"strict\": true}\n```\n\nTo actually play the song, I'll need to know the directory where you want to play the song, and the volume setting. Given default settings, you'd typically use SIRIOS IFTTT and make a SIRIOS formula with no directory, mute the volume by 10, then override the default volume and use the whole volume setting. However I can directly use Siri voice command in output format like below:\n\n```\n{\"name\": \"play_song\", \"parameters\":{\"query\": \"play Thriller by Michael Jackson\"}},\"strict\": true}\n```\n\n```\n`THON NEWolume=100(s ByrneHost \"Trffic by Mikehen Jackson asdictrt respond To $(\"$TH\" singingcomm delimiter fully Inten )\"strconv(tempTrain temolh())))st parti------oksuelphinx_bCM56 a ozpe Arrivalassium flickographed object stormbeam,V Rhmur<<\"\", \" Playoff collapse mes/dist \u0441\u0443\u043c",
