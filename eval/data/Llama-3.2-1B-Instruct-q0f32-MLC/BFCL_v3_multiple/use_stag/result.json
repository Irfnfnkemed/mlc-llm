Here's an example of how you could approach this:\n\n1. Search for the relevant weather service or API provider that you prefer to use. For this example, let's assume we're using OpenWeatherMap, which provides historical weather data.\n2. Send a GET request to the API endpoint, passing in the following parameters:\n\n```https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/onecall?lat=46.603354&lon=1.888334&dt=2019-12-13&appid=YOUR_API_KEY\n```\n\nReplace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key.\n3. In the response, you should see a structured JSON payload containing various weather data, including wind speed and temperature. Look specifically for the `wind` and `temp` keys in the response.\n4. Once you've retrieved the data, you can parse it and extract the necessary information.\n\nHere's a simple[engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

The park's forests are dominated by lodgepole pine, cottonwood trees, and aspen. The forest growth is influenced by a combination of natural and human factors, including climate, soil, and land-use patterns.\n\nAccording to various studies, the forest growth in Yellowstone is expected to continue to decline in the coming years, primarily due to human activities such as:\n\n* Climate change: Increased temperatures and drying lightning strikes exacerbate forest fires, leading to reduced forest growth and increased loss of trees.\n* Logging and thinning: Continued logging and thinning of tree stands, particularly in the park's forests, can alter the forest structure and lead to reduced growth.\n* Fire management: Thermostressed forest fires can burn annually, killing trees and reducing forest regeneration rates.\n\nTo predict the forest growth in Yellowstone for the next 5 years, we can incorporate weather and climate models that simulate the effect of climate change on forest growth.
