Here are three of the most significant:\n\n1. **The Arian Schism** (ce 318-361 AD): This was a major schism in the early Christian Church that arose between the orthodox Christians and the Arians. The Arians believed in a lesser form of God, known as the Stoic View (ambivalent view of the divine), and criticized the orthodox Christians' emphasis on the divinity of Jesus Christ. The Arian bloc eventually split to create the first Greek Orthodox Church.\n2. **The Nestorian Schism** (ce 431-527 AD): This schism occurred between the orthodox Christians and the Nestorians (a Christian sect from Armenia). The Nestorians believed that Jesus Christ was of the same substance as the Father, but in a subordinate role, while the orthodox Christians believed that Jesus was fully divine. The Nestorians were eventually forced to submit to the authority of the orthodox church.\n3. **The East-West Schism** (ce 1054 AD): This schism was a major split in the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church, resulting from disagreements over theity (divinity) of Christ,[engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

The price per square foot of high-quality marble (e.g. Carrara or Calacatta) can vary depending on the supplier and the specific type of marble. However, I can provide a rough estimate based on market prices.\n\nMarble sculptures are typically priced per unit area, which means the price per square foot is calculated based on the sculpture's size. With a 3-foot size, the area would be:\n\n3 feet x 3 feet = 9 square feet\n\nFor a rough estimate, let's use the price per square foot of Carrara marble, which is around $100 per square foot.\n\nAt $100 per square foot, the total cost for a 9-sq-feet marble sculpture would be:\n\n9 square feet x $100 per square foot = $900\n\nSo, the estimated price for a marble sculpture with a size of 3 feet would be approximately $900.\n\nIf you would like to confirm the price or need any adjustments, feel free to ask, and I can provide more information or a more detailed estimate.[engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"

This color combination creates a cozy and inviting atmosphere, perfect for relaxing and socializing.\n\nIn fact, popular online paint retailers like Sherwin-Williams and Behr recommend neutral, calming colors like Sherwin-Williams' \"Comfort Gray\" (SW 6231) and Sherwin-Williams' \"Rainwashed\" (SW 6211) for living rooms.\n\nAdditionally, some home decor experts and interior designers suggest considering soft blues or greens, such as Sherwin-Williams' \"Sea Salt\" (SW 6204) or Valspar's \"Fresh Mint\" (5013-3A), to add a touch of warmth and serenity to the space.\n\nOf course, these are just a few examples, and ultimately, the best paint color for your living room depends on your personal preferences, furniture, and decor style.

He discovered the neutron in 1932 while working at the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, England.\n\nIn 1932, Chadwick was studying the mathematical equations that describe the behavior of alpha and beta particles, which are streams of high-energy particles emitted by certain radioactive isotopes. At the time, it was believed that alpha particles were composed of a single proton and a nucleus of another element, while beta particles were thought to be composed of electrons and a positron (the antiparticle of the electron).\n\nChadwick noticed that when protons were bombarded with alpha particles, the resulting alpha particles would often have a piece of the neutron missing. Consequently, it seemed as though a neutron had been \"discovered\" - a particle that explained the observed behavior of alpha particles.\n\nFollowing this discovery, Chadwick realized that the neutron must be a distinct particle, separate from the protons and other elementary particles in matter. He made some key measurements that confirmed the existence of the neutron.\n\nChadwick's discovery of the neutron revolutionized our understanding of the structure of atomic nuclei and paved the way for the development of modern particle physics.

Historical records from that time period (circa 4 BC - 70 AD) are limited and often incomplete, and it's highly unlikely that anyone would have written about Jesus Christ in the same way that they wrote about other historical figures.\n\nIn fact, the earliest historical records of Jesus Christ date back only to around 66-70 AD, during the year of the Jewish defeat at the hands of the Roman Empire. The accounts of these events, such as the Matthew's Gospel, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Letter of Paul, are often fragmented and have been transmitted through the centuries, never in their entirety.\n\nThe earliest reliable sources, such as the fig leaf scroll (1st century AD), are personal and contain a mixture of fragmentary texts and speculative works about Jesus and his teachings. These texts were created when the Jewish community was still alive, and they were not intended as a comprehensive or definitive account of Jesus' life.\n\nThat being said, if you're interested in learning more about the earliest sources that mention Jesus Christ, I can provide you with some references to consider.[engine info] Got an invalid function call output from model"
